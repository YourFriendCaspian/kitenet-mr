# Download plug-in for Joey Hess' excellent mr tool.
#
# This allows tar balls / zip files etc. to be downloaded,
# unpacked, and used as repositories with minimal effort.
#
# Author: Adam Spiers <mr@adamspiers.org>

# INSTALLATION
# ============
#
# To make mr use this file, add a line like this inside the [DEFAULT]
# section of your ~/.mrconfig:
#
#   include = cat /usr/share/mr/download
#
# and download this handy shell-script utility which safely unpacks
# various formats of archive file:
#
#   https://raw.github.com/aspiers/shell-env/master/bin/up
#
# and place it somewhere in your $PATH.
#
# USAGE
# =====
#
# Once the module is installed, you can define repositories like this:
#
#   [foo]
#   checkout = mr_download_checkout http://example.com/foo.tar.bz2
#
# This will download the tarball into the parent directory, unpack
# it into the repository directory, and write an .mrdownload file
# containing the parameters this module needs in order to be able
# to re-download it in the future via the 'update' action.
#
# If the last segment of the URL does not represent the filename of of
# an archive (i.e. with a recognisable suffix such as .tar.gz,
# .tar.bz2, .zip etc.) then mr_download_checkout should be passed an
# second parameter which is the archive filename it should be
# downloaded to, e.g.
#
#   [fail2ban]
#   checkout = mr_download_checkout http://sourceforge.net/projects/fail2ban/files/latest/download?source=files fail2ban-latest.tar.bz2
#
# Note that it does not matter whether or not all the files in the
# archive are contained in a top-level directory, or if so, what that
# top-level directory is named.  The unpacking utility and this module
# co-operate intelligently to do the right thing, so that you don't
# have to worry about it.
#
# ACTIONS
# =======
#
# Currently only the 'checkout' and 'update' actions are supported.
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# WARNING: the 'update' action deletes the whole unpacked tree!
# Do not put any files in there which cannot be retrieved from elsewhere.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

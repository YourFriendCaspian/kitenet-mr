# stow plug-in for Joey Hess' excellent mr tool.
#
# This allows using GNU stow as a symlink manager with mr.
#
# Author: Adam Spiers <mr@adamspiers.org>

# INSTRUCTIONS
#
# To make mr use this file, add a line like this inside the [DEFAULT]
# section of your ~/.mrconfig:
#
#   include = cat /usr/share/mr/stow
#
# and then inside each [repo] section of your ~/.mrconfig for
# which you want the contents to be stowed, add this line:
#
#   stowable = true
#
# Obviously you also need stow installed.  This plug-in assumes that
# stow is on the PATH, but you can export STOW_COMMAND to override
# this if it's somewhere else.
#
# It is *strongly* recommended that you put the below snippet in your
# .mrconfig to get a version of GNU stow which has been specially
# hacked to integrate nicely with mr.  The last official GNU release
# was 1.3.3 in January 2002, but there has been an almost complete
# rewrite since then (version 2.x), and Adam subsequently became
# co-maintainer and made many further improvements which will be
# released shortly.

#     ./configure --disable-maintainer-mode --prefix=$HOME

#
# In particular, the 2002 version could create a frankenstein ~/.git/
# directory containing symlinks to multiple .git/ sub-directories in
# different stow packages!  The github version does not have this
# problem - it supports local per-directory .stow-local-ignore and
# global ~/.stow-global-ignore files, and even without configuration
# of these, it chooses sensible default ignore lists which prevent
# stowing of a package's .git/ sub-directory.  These ignore lists are
# also ideal if you only want to stow a subset of a stow package's
# contents.
#
# The default behaviour is to stow on checkout, and restow on update.
# The manual actions 'stow', 'restow', and 'unstow' are also
# available.
#
# By default, ~/.stow is used as the stow directory, and ~ as the
# target directory.  You can export STOW_DIR and STOW_TARGET to
# override these defaults.
